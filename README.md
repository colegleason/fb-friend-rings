Facebook Friend Rings
=====================

Class project for CS 467 at UIUC. 
Team members: Emelyn Baker, Cole Gleason, and Drayden Lin.

A visualization of Facebook messages between yourself and your friends.

This visualization is designed to show the interaction between you and your friends in your Facebook inbox.
It uses total number of messages and message frequency.  As nodes around the user send or receive messages with the user, the radius between the two people decrease.

 * Frequesncy is denoted by pulses between people.
 * Each message increases the proximity between that node and the central user.
 * Each step of the animation is a new time unit, usually the smallest unit is each message.
